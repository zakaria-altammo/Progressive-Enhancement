        <h2><a name="story"></a>The story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer" target="_blank" title="this is a link">farmer</a>  whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
            <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            farmer said,<strong>“Maybe.”s</strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
             and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.” </strong>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
            he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said,<q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q>
            and the farmer responded,<strong>“Maybe.”</strong>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">army</a> ,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <q>Isn’t that great!</q> 
            Again, he said,<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MkClXv2vKs" target="_blank" title="Maybe song">“Maybe.”</a></strong></p>
            <blockquote><q> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad —
            because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</q> <br> <img src="/Alan_Watts.png" alt="Alan-Watts-photo"><p class='philosopher' job='writer' name='Alan Watts' nationality='British' born='England' hair='black'>_ Alan Watts _</p></blockquote>

        <p>Conclusion  
            Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
