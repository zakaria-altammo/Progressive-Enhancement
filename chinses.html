        <h2><a name="story"></a>The story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer" target="_blank" title="this is a link">farmer</a>  whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,
            <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
            farmer said,<strong>“Maybe.”s</strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
             and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
            The farmer again said, <strong>“Maybe.” </strong>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
            he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said,<q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q>
            and the farmer responded,<strong>“Maybe.”</strong>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">army</a> ,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <q>Isn’t that great!</q> 
            Again, he said,<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MkClXv2vKs" target="_blank" title="Maybe song">“Maybe.”</a></strong></p>
            <blockquote><q> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad —
            because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</q> <br> <img src="/Alan_Watts.png" alt="Alan-Watts-photo" class="alan"><em><a name="alan"></a>-Alan Watts</em></blockquote>
         <p class='philosopher' job='writer' name='Alan Watts' nationality='British' born='England' hair='black'> Alan Wilson Watts (6 January 1915 – 16 November 1973) was a British philosopher, writer and speaker known for interpreting and popularising Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. He received a master's degree in theology from Seabury-Western Theological Seminary and became an Episcopal priest in 1945. He left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies.[2]

            Watts gained a following while working as a volunteer programmer at the KPFA radio station in Berkeley. He wrote more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosophy, introducing the emerging hippie counterculture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism. In Psychotherapy East and West (1961), he argued that Buddhism could be thought of as a form of psychotherapy. He considered Nature, Man and Woman (1958) to be, "from a literary point of view—the best book I have ever written".[3] He also explored human consciousness and psychedelics in works such as "The New Alchemy" (1958) and The Joyous Cosmology (1962).</p>

        <p>Conclusion  
            Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
