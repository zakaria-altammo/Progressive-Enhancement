        <h2>The story</h2>
        <section class="one-two">
            <p id="first"> Once upon a time there was a Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer" target="_blank" title="this is a link" class="link">farmer</a>  whose horse ran away.
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <br> <q class="quote">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> <br>
            farmer said, <br> <q class="quote"><strong>Maybe.”s</strong></q> <br>  The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
             and in the evening everybody came back and said,
            <br> <q class="quote">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> <br>
            The farmer again said, <br> <q class="quote"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> </p>
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it,
            he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said,<br> <q class="quote">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> <br>
            and the farmer responded, <br><q class="quote"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> <br>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army" target="_blank" title="wikipedia" class="link">army</a> ,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
            <br> <q class="quote">Isn’t that great!</q>Again, he said,<br> <q class="quote"><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MkClXv2vKs" target="_blank" title="Maybe song" class="link">Maybe.</a></strong> </q></p>

            <blockquote><q>  The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad —
            because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
            you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</q> <br> <em class='name'>-Alan Watts</em></blockquote>

        <p class="last">Conclusion  
            Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
